# store_item_demand_forecasting

## Problem Definition
The problem is part of a kaggle competition.
You are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.
We need to build models to compare and answer the following questions:-

* What's the best way to deal with seasonality?
* Should stores be modeled separately, or can you pool them together?
* Does deep learning work better than ARIMA? Can either beat xgboost? 

This is a great competition to explore different models and improve your skills in forecasting.
